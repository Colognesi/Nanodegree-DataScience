Why Do We Need to Process Text?

Extracting plain text: Textual data can come from a wide variety of sources: the web, PDFs, word documents, speech recognition systems, 
book scans, etc. Your goal is to extract plain text that is free of any source specific markup or constructs that are not relevant to 
your task.

Reducing complexity: Some features of our language like capitalization, punctuation, and common words such as a, of, and the, 
often help provide structure, but don't add much meaning. Sometimes it's best to remove them if that helps reduce the complexity 
of the procedures you want to apply later.

Cleaning

Let's walk through an example of cleaning text data from a popular source - the web. You'll be introduced to helpful tools in working 
with this data, including the requests library, regular expressions, and Beautiful Soup.
