In this lesson, you will be working with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:

	Knowledge Based Recommendations
	Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
	Content Based Recommendations

Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

Model Based Collaborative Filtering
Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering

In this lesson, you will implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering. In the next lesson, you will implement Model Based 
Collaborative Filtering.

Similarity Metrics
In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you will learn about some common ways to measure the similarity 
between two users (or two items) including:

	Pearson's correlation coefficient
	Spearman's correlation coefficient
	Kendall's Tau
	Euclidean Distance
	Manhattan Distance

You will learn why sometimes one metric works better than another by looking at a specific situation where one metric provides 
more information than another.

Business Cases For Recommendations
Finally, you will look at the four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue, which include:

Relevance
Novelty
Serendipity
Increased Diversity


===================================================================
knowledge based recommendation

A knowledge based recommendation is one in which knowledge about the item or user preferences are used to make a recommendation.

Knowledge based recommendations are pretty common when purchasing luxury items. Take a look at the filters available on Zillow in 
the image below. This is an example of building in a knowledge based recommendation, as users can add their own preferences to the 
items that are provided.

Often a rank based algorithm is provided along with knowledge based recommendations to bring the most popular items in particular 
categories to the user's attention.

===================================================================

Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Recommendations

Collaborative filtering is a method of making recommendations based only on the interactions between users and items.
Alternatively, content based recommendations are when we use information about the users or items to assist in our recommendations.

===================================================================

Collaborative Filtering
There are two main ways to implement collaborative filtering:

Model Based Collaborative Filtering
Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering

In this lesson, we will cover Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, which is used to identify items or users that are "neighbors" 
with one another.

There are a number of ways we might go about finding an individual's closest neighbors - the metrics we will take a closer look at include:

Similarity Based Methods
	Pearson's correlation coefficient
	Spearman's correlation coefficient
	Kendall's Tau
Each of these measures takes a value in a range of -1 to 1. Using any of these measures, as value come close to 1, it sugests that 2 individuals
are more similar. To make recomendations, we want to find users with the higher values of these coeficients., because they will be more similar
and therefore, neighbors.

Distance Based
	Euclidean Distance
	Manhattan Distance
Different from the similariry based metrics, we want to find small values between those values.
Distance based metrics can vary from 0 to infinity, the closer the individuals are to 0, they will be more similar to one another.

=====================================================

Content Based Recommendations
In the previous notebook, you implemented collaborative filtering to make recommendations based on finding similar users. However, 
there were a number of users who did not receive recommendations when using this technique. For this reason, we might use other recommendation 
techniques to find items to recommend to users.

Another popular technique for making recommendations is called content based recommendations. In this recommendation technique, we use 
information that is known about the user or item to make recommendations. This method of making recommendations is particularly useful when 
we do not have a lot of user-item connections available in our dataset.

It might be the case that content based and collaborative filtering based techniques come up with similar recommendations, but the methods 
by which data scientists approach these recommendations are very different. In collaborative filtering, you are using the connections of users 
and items (as you did before). In content based techniques, you are using information about the users and items, but not connections 
(hence the usefulness when you do not have a lot of internal data already available to use).

Let's take a look at how we might implement this method with the MovieTweetings data.
