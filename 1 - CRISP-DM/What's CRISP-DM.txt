The most commom proccess used to find most solutions on data science.
Known as "Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining" or CRISP-DM.

It's the standard proccess used in industry for data analysisfor years and has 6 major phases:

1: Business Understanding
2: Data Understanding
3: Data Preparation
4: Modeling the data
5: Evaluation of the results
6: Deployment of changes based on your analysis.

==============================

Looking on the first two phases
Business Understanding:
You need to understand the problem, Examples:

How to get more customers?
Is a new threatment better?

How to make the most of:
Trave?
Communication?
Information?

Data Understanding
Need to gain the understanding of the data you need to answear your question,
Sometimes you got a mountain pile of data that need digging through to find insights.
Other times you have to collect data, so you have to understand what kind of data will be able to provide you the kind of insigts you need.

We have 2 ways of getting to our question of interest:
Data > Question > Solution
In this case, you already got data, need to find questions of interest and then provide a solution

Question > Data > Solution
Here you have some questions, but no data, soo you need to start working on collecting the data to answear your questions.

===========================

Now entering on the 3ยบ step, Data Preparation

In this step, we're going to start collecting the Data to answear our questions of interest and after that
We'll be starting another proccess, Data Wrangling, most of the time this proccess its the most time consuming

===========================

Modeling the data

A simplified modeling proccess using scikit-learn takes 4 steps(These steps are associated to a supervised model):
1 - Instantiate our model
2 - Fit our model to our training data
3 - Use our model to predict some test data
4 - Score our model using a metric to see how it performs

===========================

Evaluation

Its the proccess where you choose the most adequate metric to work on your model
And its very important to do some tests to see how your model will react

===========================

Deployment

There are 2 main methods to use the results of your analisys
1 Deploy your model to automate tasks
2 Comunicate your data insights with others to take action, to persuade others to take a decision or take a certain action.

To comunicate with:
Developers - Github
Online Comunity - Dashboards and E-mails
