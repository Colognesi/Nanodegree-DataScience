The 4 basic methods to communicate your results are

1 Code
2 Data Visualization
3 Written Communication
4 Spoken Communication

To communicate with another developers, the best way is using github
A good readme must have:

1 Installations
2 Motivation
3 File Description
4 How to interact with your project
5 Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc...

1. Installation - Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, 
as well as what what version of python you are using should be noted.

2. Project Motivation - Discuss what your project is about, 
and what interested you in pursuing the project.

3.File Descriptions - Guide others through the files in your repository. 
You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find 
the work they might find most interesting.

4. How To Interact With Your Project - When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, 
you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? 
What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?

5.Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements - You always want to give credit where necessary. Acknowledge other contributors, 
helpful peers, data providers, etc.

=====================

Know your audience

When writing a post to a specific audience (in our case, developers or data scientist) we need to specify some things
So our post gets more atention.

Technical Audience Discussion Topics:
1 Techinical Details
2 Edge Cases
3 Data Integrity Issues
4 Thought Process
5 Creative Solutions
6 Existing Solutions

Broad Audience Discussion Topics
1 Questions of Interest
2 Results for each
3 Everyone Relates better to visuals

=========================

Captivate your audience
1: Catch their eye

We need to get the reader on their first impression of us, soo we need to do some simple things to help achieving that.
The first thing they will see, its the arcticle title and the image you choose, soo thats one of the most important things to do.

Too keep the reader on your page, you got at aproximately 2 sentences and a image to captivate the reader to stay
A usefull tatic is to tell a personal story about youserlf that the reader can relate to it too, or asking questions
your public would also ask. Another tatic its to use current events that are fresh on people's mind.
Creating content that is relevant to your public its key to keep them on your page

The content on the page should be broken up on approximately 3 lines per ideia (5 lines max). People get exausted if there's no
break on the text or dont see any visual.

2: End with a call-to-action

Need to find an ending that transmits the arguments to the reader and leaves them with a positive feeling about
the time they spent reading your article.

How to end your post:
Reiterate the main points
Call to action

============================

Logistic reminders

1 Beeing short and sweet 
Wheneaver possible will increase the number of viewers limit your post from 1 to 2 pages 
or 200 to 500 words (without counting the images),The post should take less than 8 minutes to read.

2 Create an outline
Introduction

Takeaway 1 (Example: How to break in to the field)
Takeaway 2 (Example: How these relate to salary and job satisfaction)
Takeaway 3 (What biases did respondents have)

Conclusion

3 Review your work
1 Catch small mistakes 
2 Assure you are communicating effectively
3 Also provide unfinished ideas to iterate on
